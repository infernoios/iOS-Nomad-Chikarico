Chikarico is a calm, structured app for recording recurring commitments such as subscriptions, memberships, bills, donations, courses, and personal agreements.

The app focuses on clarity and observation rather than advice or judgment. It helps you see what you are committed to and how those commitments change over time.

Commitments are recorded as ongoing entries with flexible cycles and clear states. Each one keeps its full history, making changes and pauses easy to review later. Categories, tags, and notes help keep everything organized without adding complexity.

A timeline and calendar provide a clear view of activity across time. You can see what is coming up, what has changed, and how commitments evolve, all in one place.

Analytical views summarize activity in a neutral way. Patterns across time, categories, and seasons are shown as visual overviews. The app describes what is recorded without recommendations or conclusions.

Optional reflection tools allow simple check-ins on commitments using neutral states. These records can be reviewed over time to notice transitions and changes, without evaluation or scoring.

Search, filters, and grouping tools make it easy to navigate larger lists of commitments and focus on what matters at the moment.

All data is stored locally on your device. No accounts, no cloud services, and no external tracking are used. You stay fully in control of your information.

Chikarico does not tell you what to keep or cancel.
It helps you see the full picture — clearly and calmly.
